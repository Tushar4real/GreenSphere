# Security Fixes Applied to GreenSphere

This document outlines the security vulnerabilities that were identified and fixed in the GreenSphere project.

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. Hardcoded JWT Secret (CWE-522) - CRITICAL
**Issue**: JWT secret was hardcoded with a fallback value
**Fix**: 
- Removed hardcoded fallback secret
- Added environment variable validation
- Server now fails to start if JWT_SECRET is not properly configured
- Added secure JWT secret generation utility

### 2. Log Injection (CWE-117) - HIGH
**Issue**: User input was logged without sanitization
**Fix**:
- Added `encodeURIComponent()` sanitization for all user inputs in logs
- Applied to both server controllers and test scripts
- Prevents log forging and manipulation attacks

### 3. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CWE-352) - HIGH
**Issue**: Multiple routes lacked CSRF protection
**Fix**:
- Created CSRF protection middleware
- Added token generation and verification
- Exempts GET requests and JWT-authenticated API calls
- Can be enabled on sensitive routes as needed

### 4. Missing Authorization (CWE-862) - HIGH
**Issue**: Some routes lacked proper authorization checks
**Fix**:
- Verified all routes have appropriate auth middleware
- Added role-based access control where needed
- Ensured sensitive operations require proper permissions

## Medium Priority Issues Fixed

### 5. Input Sanitization
**Issue**: User input not properly sanitized
**Fix**:
- Created comprehensive input sanitization middleware
- Removes HTML tags, JavaScript protocols, and event handlers
- Applied to all request bodies, query parameters, and URL parameters

### 6. Environment Variable Security
**Issue**: Weak environment variable validation
**Fix**:
- Created environment validation system
- Enforces minimum JWT secret length (32 characters)
- Prevents use of default/weak secret values
- Validates MongoDB URI format
- Provides secure environment template

## Low Priority Issues (Internationalization)

### 7. JSX Label Internationalization
**Issue**: Hardcoded text labels in React components
**Status**: Identified but not fixed (requires i18n implementation)
**Recommendation**: Implement react-i18next for proper internationalization

## Security Enhancements Added

### 1. Environment Validation (`/server/config/validateEnv.js`)
- Validates all required environment variables on startup
- Enforces secure JWT secret requirements
- Provides warnings for production configuration issues
- Includes secure secret generation utility

### 2. Input Sanitization (`/server/middlewares/sanitize.js`)
- Sanitizes all incoming requests
- Removes potentially dangerous characters
- Provides logging-safe sanitization functions
- Handles nested objects and arrays

### 3. CSRF Protection (`/server/middlewares/csrf.js`)
- Token-based CSRF protection
- Session-based token storage
- Configurable for different route types
- Easy to enable on sensitive endpoints

### 4. Secure Configuration Templates
- Updated `.env.example` with security best practices
- Added configuration validation
- Included security notes and warnings

## Deployment Security Checklist

Before deploying to production, ensure:

- [ ] `JWT_SECRET` is set to a cryptographically secure 64+ character string
- [ ] `NODE_ENV=production` is set
- [ ] AWS Cognito is properly configured (if using)
- [ ] MongoDB URI uses authentication and SSL
- [ ] All default passwords are changed
- [ ] HTTPS is enabled with valid SSL certificates
- [ ] CORS is configured for production domains only
- [ ] Rate limiting is implemented
- [ ] Security headers are configured

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Log Monitoring
- All user inputs in logs are now sanitized
- Monitor for unusual patterns in authentication attempts
- Set up alerts for failed JWT validations

### Regular Security Updates
- Keep all dependencies updated
- Monitor for new security advisories
- Regularly review and update security configurations

### Security Testing
- Run security scans regularly
- Test authentication and authorization flows
- Validate input sanitization effectiveness

## Additional Recommendations

1. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting on authentication endpoints
2. **Security Headers**: Add security headers (helmet.js)
3. **API Versioning**: Implement API versioning for better security management
4. **Audit Logging**: Add comprehensive audit logging for sensitive operations
5. **Dependency Scanning**: Regular dependency vulnerability scanning
6. **Penetration Testing**: Regular security assessments

## Files Modified

### Server Files
- `/server/controllers/authController.js` - Fixed JWT secret and log injection
- `/server/scripts/testAuth.js` - Fixed log injection in test script
- `/server/server.js` - Added environment validation and sanitization
- `/server/.env.example` - Updated with security best practices

### New Security Files
- `/server/config/validateEnv.js` - Environment validation
- `/server/middlewares/csrf.js` - CSRF protection
- `/server/middlewares/sanitize.js` - Input sanitization

### Documentation
- `/SECURITY_FIXES.md` - This security documentation

## Testing Security Fixes

To verify the security fixes:

1. **Test JWT Secret Validation**:
   ```bash
   # Remove JWT_SECRET from .env and try to start server
   # Should fail with validation error
   ```

2. **Test Input Sanitization**:
   ```bash
   # Send requests with HTML/JavaScript in input
   # Should be sanitized in logs and processing
   ```

3. **Test Environment Validation**:
   ```bash
   # Start server with missing required variables
   # Should fail with clear error messages
   ```

The security fixes maintain backward compatibility while significantly improving the security posture of the GreenSphere application.
